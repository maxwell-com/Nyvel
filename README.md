# Nyvel
0ffcial website for Nyvel company and co. 

# Commits
I should be the only one making commits becuase frankly, you can't code, and that is a massice skill issue.

# Product
I need some mock prosuct name and specs so list them here

# Website visiblity and hosting
We should use railway, because I have a bias for there futuristic ui.

# Domain 
Could we use magsaved.store? That would work for testing and showing progress easily to others. (mostly cuz I have ego issues and want praise)
